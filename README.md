# Hue Harnesser - Current Version: 1.1

  Hue Harnesser is a color focused app for the artists, designers and color enthusiasts out there who want to easily capture, generate and preview colors or color schemes.

  The Hue Extractor feature uses the images in your Photos Library or photos taken on the fly with your camera, automatically determining the red, green, blue and alpha values for a specified color in an image, which can be stored for later reference. The Hue Picker feature allows you to create custom colors by specifying their red, green, blue and alpha values, which you can store for later use. And color schemes of up to 4 colors can be easily formulated and viewed by loading saved colors into the Hue Picker feature.
